# Retinal image registration

Note: as it contains confidential health data, the private dataset cannot be shared with TAs. This is why results (registered images) won't be available in the shared repository. Nevertheless, shared versions of the notebooks will contains images taken from a public dataset for illustration purposes.

## Content

Our source code contains 3 folders representing the 3 steps we took for this project.

1. `Experiment and cross correlation` contains the first experiments we made, and a first working solution (cross-correlation).
2. `Feature matching` goes deeper into feature matching and implements a second working solution.
3. `Deep learning` tries deep learning methods using voxelmorph, without giving satisfactory results.

Each folder contains (at least) one notebook explaining more in details what has been done.

## How to run

Each folder contains a readme explaining how to run the code. Specifically, the first folder contains a cross-correlation working algorithm, and the second a feature matching working algorithm.

## Where to find results

- `Feature matching/full_output/` contains registered images using the feature matching algorithm.
- `Experiments and cross correlation/4_cross-correlation/output/` contains registered images using the cross correlation algorithm.
